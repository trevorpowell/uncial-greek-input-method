# Uncial Greek Input Method
Unicode input method for typing in Uncial Greek on Mac

# Key Mapping
The key mapping for the input method matches the standard Greek keyboard layout but uses uncial script characters from the Coptic Unicode block. This is useful for rendering early biblical manuscripts visually in plain text. Because it uses the characters from the Coptic block, in settings where fonts can be embedded and applied, using the characters from the Greek block and applying an uncial script font is probably preferable.
